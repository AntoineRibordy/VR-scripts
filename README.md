# What is it?
These scripts are handy scripts I'm using to build a VR mobile game. They are intended for use with Google Cardboard. I'm using them in conjunction with Unity 3D.

# How to Use
Add a script you want to use as a component on a Unity GameObject. Drag and drop any required missing element for the script in the Inspector in Unity.

Read the comments in the code to understand what the script does. In most cases, the name of the script will give you a good hint at what it does.

Most of the scripts have to do with gathering resources in a 3D world and using them to interact with other objects of the game world.

# Supported SW / Compatibility
The scripts work with Unity 5.4. This is what I'm using to build the game.

If you want to use them for earlier version of Unity (in particular with Unity 4), you'll have to change the syntax of some commands.

# More Information / Contributing
As the scripts are evolving, it's not out of the question that you'll encounter issues with them at one point or another.

If you want to contribute and add your own functionality, feel free to fork the whole repository and later submit a pull request. I will take any request into consideration.
